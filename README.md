## RULES -
1 - Make a single loop with lines passing through the centers of cells, horizontally or vertically.

2 - The loop never crosses itself, branches off

3 - The loop should never go through the same cell twice.

4 - Lines must pass through all cells with black and white circles.

5 - Lines passing through white circles must pass straight through its cell

6 - Line passing through white circles must make a right-angled turn in at least one of the cells next to the white circle.

7 - Lines passing through black circles must make a right-angled turn in its cell

8 - Line passing through black circles  must go straight through the next cell (till the middle of the second cell) on both sides.


## Constraint Satisfaction Problem 
Understanding the nuances of the circles and how they interact with each other is the key to solving a Masyu puzzle
