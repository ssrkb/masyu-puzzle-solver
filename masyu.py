# Pairs of adjacent cells may be either linked with an edge or unlinked. Linked edges must form a
# single continuous chain that doesn't intersect itself. The chain must pass through every cell with
# a circle. If the circle is white it must pass straight through. If the circle is black it must
# make a 90 degree turn there.
